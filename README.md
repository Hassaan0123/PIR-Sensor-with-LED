# PIR-Sensor-with-LED
This Is PIR Sensor.PIR Sensor detect the Heat.PIR Sensor connect with arduino uno board with three pins.This sensor is many example.
For example:This type sensor are attach with gates of big malls.Any Person enter in mall the pir sensor detects the Person and doors are open.
The PIR Sensor attach with mall gates has great algorithm.The tabs remain open until the Person enter in the mall.
There is an LED connected with arduino uno board.
The IR Sensor detects any of object the LED is on from which we know about any objects
